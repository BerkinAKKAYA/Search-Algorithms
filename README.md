# Search-Algorithms

I implemented some search and sort algorithms to unity and visualized them.

* Application creates a random array and you can sort it using editor with an algorithm you select.
* Application picks a random number in array, you can find its index in array using an algorithm you select in editor.

### Searching Algorithms Implemented
* Linear
* Binary
* Jump
* Interpolation
* Exponential
* Ternary
